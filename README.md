# Carbon Calculated Api# 
 
This is the [Carbon Calculated API](http://api-docs.carboncalculated.com/).

But this Server can be used to serve computation API that you wanted.

Example *Meal Calorie Calculator*, basically anything that has a formula
and objects; 

JSON is served with a Sinatra Application and the help of mongodb.

Soon to be open sources is the admin application that pumps data into
the platform for this application to serve.

*Note* This is not ready for general consumption as of yey, alot of things need to
be pulled and pushed out to make that ready, also the specs are run
against something a bit differrent; and bits and bobs need to be
updated.

So be patient await some

so ignore below 

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests ##
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
